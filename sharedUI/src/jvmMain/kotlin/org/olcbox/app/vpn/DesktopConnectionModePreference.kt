/**
 * Which of the two ways of carrying traffic the person chose, on the desktops
 * that have two.
 *
 * Android has had this choice since it had a tun, and the desktop never did —
 * not because it was taken away, but because until macOS grew a tunnel every
 * desktop had exactly one mode available and the settings screen showed a card
 * that looked like a chooser and was a label. This is the same idea as
 * `AndroidConnectionMode`, deliberately: same two names, same meaning, so that
 * one explanation covers every platform.
 *
 * Availability is not uniform and cannot be, so it is reported rather than
 * assumed: Linux has no system-proxy implementation at all
 * (`UnsupportedProxyController`), and macOS cannot use a tun until its root
 * daemon has been approved.
