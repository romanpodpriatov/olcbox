/**
 * Groups the locations that are the same exit reached over different transports.
 *
 * The coordinator publishes one exit three times and distinguishes them by a name
 * suffix: `US via RU | 0.13TON/GB`, `… · Hysteria2`, `… · XHTTP`. The edge host is
 * NOT usable as the key — one RU edge fronts US, JP, IT and IN, so host grouping
 * would mix countries.
 *
 * If that naming convention ever changes, every group collapses to a single member:
 * fallback quietly stops happening, which is the safe direction. A wrong grouping
 * would connect someone to another country; a missing one only costs the feature.
