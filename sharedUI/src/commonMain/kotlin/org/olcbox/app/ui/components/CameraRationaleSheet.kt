/**
 * Why this app wants a camera, before the system asks.
 *
 * The scanner used to be launched straight from the add sheet, so the first
 * thing a user saw was the operating system's own permission prompt with no
 * explanation attached — and on iOS that prompt is the only chance there is: a
 * declined camera permission cannot be asked for twice.
 *
 * It is also the honest answer to a reasonable suspicion. A VPN client asking for
 * a camera looks like a VPN client asking for a camera, and the reason is narrow
 * enough to state in three lines.
 *
 * The shape is App Review's, not ours (guideline 5.1.1(iv), which rejected
 * 1.0.392): a message before a permission request may explain, and may not
 * gate. One button, worded neutrally — "Continue", not "Allow and scan" — and
 * no way to wave the message away, because a "Not now" that skips the system
 * prompt is "delaying the permission request". The decision itself is made in
 * the system prompt that follows, where it belongs.
