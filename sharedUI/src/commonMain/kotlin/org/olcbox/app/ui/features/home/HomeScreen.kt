/**
 * The board, and the two pinned things that frame it.
 *
 * What changed from the layout this replaces, and why: the 200dp circular power
 * dial is gone. It was the most recognisable piece of a silhouette shared with
 * every other sing-box front end, it ate the top third of the screen to say one
 * word, and it could not name what it would connect to. The bar at the bottom
 * always does.
 *
 * Everything here is state and effects; the layout itself is `HomeScreenContent`.
