/**
 * Spawns and supervises a bundled core binary (sing-box / xray) on Android by
 * exec'ing it from nativeLibraryDir in SOCKS mode — the v2rayNG pattern. The core
 * binary is packaged as `lib<name>.so` in jniLibs and, with useLegacyPackaging,
 * extracted to nativeLibraryDir where it is executable. The existing
 * hev-socks5-tunnel bridge points at the core's SOCKS port; this class only owns
 * the child process.
 *
 * minSdk is 23, so this deliberately uses only API-23-safe process APIs:
 * `Process.destroy()` / `exitValue()` — NOT `toHandle()`, `descendants()`,
 * `destroyForcibly()`, `isAlive()`, or `waitFor(timeout, unit)` (all API 26+).
 * `destroy()` sends SIGTERM, which the Go cores handle by exiting cleanly.
