"""Upload an Android App Bundle to a Google Play track.

The Android half of what the iOS job does with TestFlight: one call from CI,
authenticated as a service account the Play Console was told about, and the
build is on the track a minute later. Two things the API will not do, by
Google's design, and this script therefore expects to have happened already:
registering the app (the first bundle of a new app goes through the console by
hand) and choosing the signing key (App integrity -> App signing, before that
first bundle).

Needs google-api-python-client and google-auth. The service account needs
"Release to testing tracks" on the app for `internal`, and "Release to
production" for `production`.
