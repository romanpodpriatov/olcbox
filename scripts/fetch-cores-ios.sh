# Puts Cores.xcframework where the Xcode extension target expects it.
#
# One framework holding sing-box, Xray and olcRTC — they cannot be linked apart,
# see build-cores-ios.sh. Building it needs Go, gomobile and a macOS machine, so
# this looks for one already built, in the order that costs least:
#
#   1. the destination itself   — nothing to do
#   2. the local cache          — a copy; survives `clean`
#   3. the release tag          — a download
#
# The cache exists because the destination is inside `sharedUI/build`, which is
# Gradle's to delete and which Gradle does delete: it is the declared output of
# fetchCoresIosXcframework, and a stale-output sweep once removed a framework
# that had taken twenty minutes to build and could not be re-downloaded, because
# the release for that version pair did not exist yet. A locally built framework
# now lands in the cache too, so losing the build directory costs a copy.
#
# The tag names the versions it was built from, so a version bump is a new tag
# rather than a silent swap — and a new cache entry rather than a stale hit.
# That only holds while the tag is *derived*: it was a literal here once, olcRTC
# was re-pinned without it, and this script went on restoring a framework built
# from the previous revision. Nothing looked wrong, because step 1 below finds
# the freshly built framework in the destination and returns before the stale
# cache entry is ever consulted — until Gradle sweeps the destination, which is
# exactly what it is documented above to do.
