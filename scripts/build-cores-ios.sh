# Cores.xcframework — sing-box, Xray and olcRTC, bound together in one framework.
#
# They have to share a framework, not merely a binary. Each `gomobile bind`
# emits its own copy of the cgo bootstrap and the gomobile seq layer, so linking
# two independently-bound frameworks into one extension fails at link time:
#
#   duplicate symbol '_crosscall2'          duplicate symbol '_IncGoRef'
#   duplicate symbol '__cgo_topofstack'     duplicate symbol '_DestroyRef'
#   duplicate symbol '_x_cgo_bindm'         duplicate symbol '_proxy_error_Error'
#   ... 49 duplicate symbols
#
# There is no linker flag for this, and hiding one copy would be worse than the
# error: two Go runtimes in one process means two schedulers and two sets of
# signal handlers. One bind over all three packages gives one runtime and one
# copy of the glue, which is the only correct shape.
#
# The class names do not change — prefixes come from the Go package names, so
# `LibboxBoxService`, `LibXrayInvoke` and `MobileStartWithTransport` are still
# exactly that. Only the module to import changes, to `Cores`.
#
# The build tags are load-bearing. Without with_gvisor there is no userspace
# stack for the tun, without with_quic no Hysteria2, without with_utls no
# Reality fingerprinting.
