/// Answers the system when it says memory is running short.

/// This is not part of `MemoryWatch`, which is a debugging instrument meant to
/// be switched off once it has answered its question. This is a mitigation and
/// stays on.
///
/// The case it exists for is the one 1.0.411 produced: the extension died at
/// 39 MB of a 50 MB allowance, with 10.9 MB still reported as available by
/// `os_proc_available_memory`. Its own ceiling was not the thing it hit. A
/// packet tunnel provider sits low in the jetsam band, so when the *device*
/// runs short — a speed test is one of the few things a phone does that makes
/// that happen — the extension is an early choice, well below its own limit.
///
/// iOS warns before it starts killing. Two things are done with the warning:
///
///   * the runtime hands back everything it has collected but not yet released,
///     because a process judged on its footprint is charged for memory it is no
///     longer using;
///   * the event is written to the diagnostics, which is the point that matters
///     for the next failure. If a death is preceded by a pressure warning, the
///     device was short and the extension was chosen; if it is not, something
///     else killed it and memory is the wrong thread to keep pulling.
